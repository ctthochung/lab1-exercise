# What I hope to learn in INFO 201 

This course is my first introduction to both **coding** and *informatics*. 
I'm an international studies major and haven't had any exposure to programming.

### My learning goals for this course: 
- Understanding the basics of R 
- Learning how to visualize and interpret data
- Apply these skills to my major
